**Problem Statement**: 
* Your client is PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to small and medium sized enterprises.
* The energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from.
* PowerCo are concerned about their customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers. When a customer leaves to use another service provider, this is called **churn**.
This is becoming a big issue for PowerCo and they have engaged BCG to help diagnose the reason why their customers are churning.

**Task To be Performed**:
* the data that we’ll need from the client and
* the techniques we’ll use to investigate the issue.

**My Approach**:

* Try to assess the key areas which influences customer retention to an organisation like this 
* Gauge on that and understand the data sources needed to solve this like purchasing trends,churn data etc.
* Classify the problem as classification / regression and find conclusions through EDA and do model evaluation.
