  It has has 4 tasks
        
        1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
        2: Exploratory Data Analysis And Data Cleaning
        3: Feature Engineering 
        4: Modelling and evaluation 
        4: Findings & Recommendations


## TASK-1(Business Understanding)


**Problem Statement**: 
* Your client is PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to small and medium sized enterprises.
* The energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from.
* PowerCo are concerned about their customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers. When a customer leaves to use another service provider, this is called **churn**.
This is becoming a big issue for PowerCo and they have engaged BCG to help diagnose the reason why their customers are churning.

**Task To be Performed**:
* the data that we’ll need from the client and
* the techniques we’ll use to investigate the issue.

**My Approach**:

* Try to assess the key areas which influences customer retention to an organisation like this 
* Gauge on that and understand the data sources needed to solve this like purchasing trends,churn data etc.
* Classify the problem as classification / regression and further choose the Machine Learning Algorithims that can be applied and lastly choose the one which has the best interpretability and accuracy.

## TASK-2(Exploratory Data Analysis)

**Task To be Performed**:
* To investigate whether price sensitivity is the most influential factor for a customer churning and define price sensitivity

**Analysis**
* churn rate is about 9-10%.
* understand the correlation of churn using different columns like origin , sales channel , original date of contract etc 
* different sales channel show different rates of churn , electricity campaigns and the length of time the customer was associated with product/organisation.
* different skewed graphs were plotted to understand consumption across various months and forecast
* more churn in less number of active products or services was observed which meant powerCo needed to focus on itsless active products or services
